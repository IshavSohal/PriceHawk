### Release Goal
As indicated on the course site, the project's goals are to be completed within 3 sprints. Since we have around 15 high to medium priority user stories, we agreed as a team to aim for the completion of 5 user stories (at least 3 as per the requirements) per sprint. As highlighted on the project backlog document, we aim to finish the stories with high priority first.

<ins>The release goals include</ins>:
- A functioning chrome extension that allows users to track the price of items 
- Useable by 
    - Guest users (do not have to register)
    - Pro users (registered users)
- An interface that allows users to track the price of items for multiple vendors
- A notification system that notifies users of changes in the prices of items they are tracking

<ins>We also agreed on goals for development</ins>:
- Code should be easily extendable by new developers so it should follow:
    - Good documentation
    - OOP
    - Clean code (maintainable and easily understandable by other devs)
- The code should also be tested thoroughly before release

### Scope of the Project

- Different paid plans for different types of users 
- Advertise extension on forums to attract our first batch of test users
