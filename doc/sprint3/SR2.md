**Unfinished stories as new stories:**
* User story 6: Forgot password

<br>

**What are practices that you should continue during next sprint**

One new practice that we were required to follow was creating burndown charts. After reflecting on these new practices, the team agreed that we all felt anxious and stressed as the deadline for the sprint approached and looking at our burndown chart this can be explained by how we prioritized finishing all our stories in the last few days. By tracking our progress using this, we are now more aware of how to spread our progress throughout the sprint instead of the last few days. This reflection practice was appreciated by the whole group and we believe it will be effective again in the next sprint.

<br>

**What are some new collaborative practices that you might want to use during next sprint**

* A new practice that we learned about during the last sprint was creating network diagrams for the different dependencies amongst the tasks. Creating this diagram helped us see tasks that were more critical than others and tasks that can block other tasks. 

* We want to experiment with prioritizing these critical and blocking tasks at an earlier stage of our sprint to see if it improves our development and efficiency (progress velocity of our burndown chart).

<br>

**What are (if any) harmful collaborative practices you should stop using during next sprint**

* Lack of communication was a big problem during our first sprint. Even though we tried to address this issue, it was hard to avoid it given everyone’s busy schedule.

* Assigning tightly coupled tasks to different team members

    * Instead of creating a backend + frontend task for every user story, many times it was better just to have the same person work on both tasks since you can’t easily independently work on them.


<br>

**What was your best experience as a group during sprint 2**

* It was nice working together with others to successfully complete and demo our features.

* Again, we all appreciated learning new skills (examples: pagination, content/background scripts, etc.)

<br>

**What was your worst experience as a group during sprint 2**

* We started many of the tasks towards the end of the sprint which caused some stress. It would’ve been better to start the tasks earlier, and slowly work on them, rather than do all the work at the end.
