### How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?

To distribute workload evenly for sprint 0, we had meetings on Discord and in person to split up the sprint 0 deliverables amongst the team members. We also divided our group into sub-groups. We have sub-groups for the frontend, backend, and DB portions of the project. We assigned deliverables to group members by figuring out which deliverable relates to which sub-group. For example, since Mustafa is going to be working in the frontend, he was assigned the UI/UX deliverable. 
  
<ins>Frontend</ins>: Mustafa, Ishav, Ethan

<ins>Backend</ins>: Justin, Taha, Ovi, Ryan

##### Assigned deliverables 

|Deliverable   |Assignee(s)   |
|---|---|
|Proposal.md|Ishav, Ryan |
|Competition.md|Ethan |
|Personas.md|Ishav, Justin |
|PB.md|Ovi, Justin, Taha|
|Setup|Justin, Taha|
|UI/UX|Mustafa|
|Process.md|Everyone (meeting)|
|Done.md|Everyone (meeting)|
|README.md|Justin|




A main Google doc was made which included the deliverable for each section. This allowed the team to view everyone's progress and also provide feedback to each other. 

A trello sprint board was also made to brainstorm user stories for the product backlog. 

The UI/UX was designed using [figma](https://www.figma.com/).

And to set up the repository, pull requests on GitHub were made to ensure the starter code was approved before being merged to master.

We had a final meeting to review all of the deliverables as a team to approve for submission on the main repository.

### How did you make decisions?

We had several in-person meetings and online meetings on Discord to discuss goals, deadlines and brainstorm ideas. This included creating proposal.mds for multiple project ideas and debating the pros and cons as a team. We also consulted with the Professor and TAâ€™s in office hours about our ideas to get a better understanding of what is expected.

Initially, we submitted multiple proposal ideas and had planned to pursue the idea that had the best feedback. A lot of stress was put on creating a novel idea, so in the end, we ended up pursuing one of the ideas the professor suggested, which the team also mostly agreed upon. 

### How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

As a team, we categorized each User Story on a Priority Scale of Low - High. The final priority of each story was voted on by the whole team. This consisted of 2 rounds of voting. In the first round, the team agreed on the prioritization of most of the stories, while the 2nd round was for finalizing decisions for priorities on stories that we had disagreements on in the prior round. The prioritization table is in PB.md.


### How frequently did you meet? 

On any given week we met around 3 times: 2 of which were in person meetings after the weekly tutorial and lecture, and once/twice on discord. 

### What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

One of the challenges that we noticed with having such a large team was poor communication. It was hard to organize meeting times that worked for everyone. Holding frequent meetings definitely helped out with decision making and deliverable completion, but not all group members were always available for all the meetings. Going forward, we aim to find the right balance.
