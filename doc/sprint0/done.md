For someone to "complete" a user story, they would have to merge their PR branch to the master branch, and before doing so, the following criteria needs to be met:

* The PR should satisfy the acceptance criteria set for its user story.

* The PR should have approval from a majority of team members (other than the PR owner(s)) that act as the "reviewers"

* Each PR owner(s) should implement a basic set of tests and testing criteria for the reviewers

Completion of all the user stories according to the criteria above indicates project completion.
