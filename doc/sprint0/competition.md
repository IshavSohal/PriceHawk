The Honey extension's primary purpose is to lookup and apply digital coupons to items at checkout on various websites . Although it also contains the features to compare an 
item's price history and be notified of price drops on that site. The user can also search items on the honey site and it will list different stores that sell that item and 
their corresponding prices so users can easily compare.

Well Honey certainly has many of the same features of Price Hawk, that isn’t its main objective. It’s likely many users of Honey don't realize it also does price matching as 
it’s only on their actual website where price matching is available. With Price Hawk it’s clear the objective of the product, to easily add items to compare prices all in the 
extension, with then the option of going to our site to see further information.

Price dropper is a website that targets the same problem as our product as their
primary focus. It compares prices on an item listed online by showing different stores with their corresponding price of the item. It also has the features to see an item's 
price history and the ability for users to add items to a price watch list so they can keep track of any price changes of items they wish to purchase.

Our product differs from pricedropper as it’s an extension that can easily be opened on any online store. A situation where users may benefit from Price Hawk over pricedropper 
is where they are casually looking through online stores to find any items that may interest them. Instead of the user looking for a specific item on the pricedropper site, 
they can find anything that interests them and simply add the item to watch for any price changes or compare with other sellers with our product.

These sites are similar as in they just focus on amazon for price tracking. Camelcamelcamel is a website affiliated with amazon that allows users to search items that are 
listed on amazon. To then see the item's price history and to be notified when it drops in price. They also have an extension to work on amazon so users won’t have to leave 
the site. Well pricyapp is just an web extension that works only on amazon with similar features. 

Well both these products are web extensions just like Price Hawk with very similar features. They are limited just to amazon, whereas Price Hawk is able to compare with any 
online store. So users have the option to shop from wherever they like, while still having an extension to easily compare prices.
