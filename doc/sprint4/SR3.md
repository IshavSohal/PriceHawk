**Unfinished stories as new stories:**
* User story 6: Forgot password
* frontend for User story 19: Data Filtering and Sorting (backend complete)

<br>

**What are practices that you should continue during next sprint**

* Finding the right balance between partnering up to work on a user story and not assigning tightly coupled tasks between multiple developers. If one partner is stuck on something, the other might be able to help out but two developers shouldn’t depend too much on each other.

* One thing that worked last sprint was creating a network diagram early into the sprint. This helped us map out what features will be dependent on others and hence we prioritized them. The group felt that this improved our sprint progress efficiency.


<br>

**What are some new collaborative practices that you might want to use during next sprint**

* Using pair programming to complete user stories might help with creating an optimal solution.

* When someone’s stuck on a user story, brainstorming with others could be used to help unblock that person.


<br>

**What are (if any) harmful collaborative practices you should stop using during next sprint**

Merging the develop branch to master in the final moments before the due date. This is a bad practice since we encountered many merge conflicts that took a long time to resolve, right before the deadline


<br>

**What was your best experience as a group during sprint 2**

*Feedback*: We received positive feedback from the TA during the demo. Our work being appreciated raised everyone’s morale after a tough sprint. We also received suggestions on how to improve for the next sprint which we also appreciated.

**What was your worst experience as a group during sprint 2**

*Bug fixing*: When preparing for the demo and after the features had been merged to dev, the group ended up finding a lot of bugs. Some bugs were 1 line changes but took hours to fix. This was a frustrating experience for everyone.
