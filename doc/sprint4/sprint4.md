**User Story Decisions:**

|User Story|Story Acceptance Criteria|Story Points|
|--|--|--|
|User story 6: Forgot Password|<ul><li>Upon clicking forgot password in the login UI, another form UI should prompt the user to enter their new password and retype their new password</li><li>The user should receive an email to the email associated with their account that has a code</li><li>The user needs to input this code under the password fields and then click the change password button for their password to be reset</li><li>Upon successful reset, the form UIs should disappear, the user should get a quick tooltip that reads "password changed", and they should be logged in</li></ul>|3|
|User Story 14:Notify Price Changes|<ul><li>The user should get an email notification to the email linked to their account (if enabled) upon a price change</li><li>This feature is enabled in the settings tab (see user story 15)</li><li>For user initiated updates, alert the user of a price change via the extension.</li></ul>|3|
|User Story 12: Price Tracking|At a user-configurable timeframe, rescan the stored itemâ€™s price and update it if there's a change.|5|
|User story 11: Tracking Page: Item Organization (multiple sellers per item)|If a user has multiple items with the same name, those items should be organized so that the item name appears on the dropdown, and inside the dropdown all the vendors for that item should appear in a table. All previous functionality remains the same: each row in the table in the dropdown is the same as the row in the previous view where all items would be displayed in a single table (refresh, delete, price history)|5|
|User story 19: Data Filtering and Sorting|<ul><li>For each item, the user can sort the vendors by ascending/descending prices, by ascending/descending first date created or by vendors that had a recent price update (after a certain date inputted by user)</li><li>The sorting and filter should only apply to the vendors within the item dropdown</li></ul>|5|
|User Story 23: Guest User Migration|If the guest user has any data stored and they had just made an account or signed in with an SSO, their data should be transferred to the server.|3|
|User story 3: Guest User|By default, users of the extension should be "signed in" as guests and be able to add items to track right away, so, in the top of the toolbox panel, the user's given guest ID should be visible (user6, user5974, ...)|1|
