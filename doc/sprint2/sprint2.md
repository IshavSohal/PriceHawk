**User Story Decisions**

| User Story  | Story Acceptance Criteria |Story Points|
| ----------- | -----------|---|
|User story 6: Forgot Password|<ul><li>Upon clicking forgot password in the login UI, another form UI should prompt the user to enter their new password and retype their new password</li><li>The user should receive an email to the email associated with their account that has a code</li><li>The user needs to input this code under the password fields and then click the change password button for their password to be reset</li><li>Upon successful reset, the form UIs should disappear, the user should get a quick tooltip that reads "password changed", and they should be logged in</li></ul>|3|
|User Story 7: SSO login|<ul><li>Give the user the option to login with their google account in a single click</li><li>This option should be in the sign in form at the bottom labeled by "sign in with" and then the options stated above as icons</li></ul>|5|
|User story 1: tracking page|<ul><li>When the user clicks our extension icon in their web browser, a small "toolbox" panel should come up</li><li>In the panel, when a user clicks a button/icon link, it should open a new tab that displays all the items they're tracking and all their related data (seller name, price, etc.)</li><li>The tracking page should show all the data (item list) that the user is tracking</li><li>The user should be able to delete an item</li></ul>|8|
|User Story 8: extract name and price|<ul><li>Like in user story 2, when clicking the add item button, a UI form to create the item pops up (input fields: item name, item price). These input fields should be read only</li><li>On the item name field, there should be a clickable "select item name" tooltip</li><li>When the tooltip is clicked, (just like the AdBlock feature to select an element on the page to block) the user should be able to hover anywhere on the page to select the DOM element that contains the item's name.</li><li>After the user selects the element containing the name of the product, the name field should be filled with the name and another tooltip should pop up on top of the "item price" field, that when clicked, should prompt the user to select the DOM element that has the price. After selection, the price field should be filled automatically with the selected price.</li><li>After they hit "save item", the item is added to their profile's tracking page and the tracking info (DOM elements) are sent to server.</li></ul>|13|
