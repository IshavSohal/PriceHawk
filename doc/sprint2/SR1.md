**What are practices that you should continue during next sprint**

We found it really effective to set points and priorities for the user stories we attempted. This allowed us to plan our time accordingly by prioritizing highly critical tasks over less critical tasks and meet the final sprint deadline. Setting a point system based on task difficulty also allowed us to improve productivity as tasks with higher points were put a bigger focus on earlier into the sprint.

**What are some new collaborative practices that you might want to use during next sprint**
* To improve communication, we could create separate voice/text channels on discord where each belongs to a group working on a specific user story
* Keep the meetings shorter (10-15mins) so we have more time to code (but also having them more frequently for better communication)
* Setting up “conflict” meetings where members (who cannot proceed with their task because of a blocker) can show up and request whoever is blocking them to show up as well to resolve the conflict or have a temporary work around so progress can continue

**What are (if any) harmful collaborative practices you should stop using during next sprint**
* Lack of communication
    * User story roles were switched between members due to miscommunication after initial planning

* Over-assigning tasks
    * The team assigned > 3 user stories to more evenly distribute the workload instead of focusing all of our resources on 3 features. Despite finishing our 3 features, it could’ve been more effective to stay within the sprint requirements.
    
**What was your best experience as a group during sprint 1**
* Successfully demoing our project's 3 features was a big achievement for our team.

* Despite the struggles with learning the technology that came with developing a chrome extension and a backend to serve its requests, the team found the whole experience to be a rewarding process as we all gained a lot of new skills.

**What was your worst experience as a group during sprint 1**
* It was hard to align everyone’s schedule to work together in a nicer manner. In fact, a common bad experience amongst the group members was waiting to join a standup meeting and not finding anyone to share their updates with.
